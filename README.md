Repository for team Saltaretii during the Facebook Hackathon on October 19th.

The app is able to keep track of mountain routes created by users, and to display information for every one of them, like elevations, distance, difficulty, meta-information
like "it's closed during winters" etc. Currently we only support showing elevations for routes inside our db, check it on heroku.

Also the interface is a proof of concept which should be extended to having images all over the map, with infos like where caban X is. We can only
search for routes and add a new route.
